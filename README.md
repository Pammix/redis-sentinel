# Redis Sentinel Setup

If you need to test your system with High-availability Redis Sentinels, you need to setup sentinels locally.

This repo provide simple script and step to set it up.

## Steps

#### Install Redis. 
For Mac OS I recommend *brew install redis*
#### Run start.sh
Detail explanation of the setup

In this setup, we have *3 Redis instances*

* Master Redis at port *6380*
* Slave Redis at port *6379*
* Redis Sentinels at port *26379*

The slave Redis is a replicate of Master redis. It's act as a fallback Redis.

Now if you use any driver and connect to sentinels at 26379, now you have High-availability setup for Redis.

The most simple test you can run is to connect to sentinels, shutdown the Redis at 6380 port by using SHUTDOWN command and see if your connection still works. It should take around 500 milliseconds to automatically reconnect to Redis at port 6379.
